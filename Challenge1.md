# **Cadence's Therapy - A Concert**
I am very passionate about music its artistical meanings. I listen to all sort of genres: Pop, R&B, Indie, Hyper-Pop, Alternative, Latin, and Hip-hop. One of my favorite hobbies, or even a personality trait some would say, is going to concerts. I have been to 11 concerts since 2019, and I have 2 coming up before the year ends. 

## *My appreciation towards Live Music* 
One of the funny things is that I didn't know that the concept of a concert was a thing until I went to my first one in 2019. However, my love for live music started after my second concert in 2022. My favorite part about live music are the voice changes and adlibs artists are capable of doing live. Yes, the studio version of a song is great; however when an artist plays a song live, they can have it produced differently for a concert like adding more drums, more beats, or even speed it up or slow it down - something to make it a little different.

 For example, Doja Cat's song, "Say So," is pop, but there is a version of this song from the [2020 MTV EMA's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3Yk6FrjMkQ) where the production of this version is more punk pop where more guitar and drums are added. However, when she sang this live during her concert, it had a light intrumental background with occuring drums for the beat drops. 

 Live music not only consists of the artist themselves - you will see that alot of live shows have different stage setups with different props and dancers for choreography. 

 This is the beauty of live music - It allows the artist to express themselves, their creativity, and their vocal talent.
